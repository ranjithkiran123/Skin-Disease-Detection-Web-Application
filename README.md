Skin diseases are among the most prevalent illnesses affecting individuals
worldwide. Skin cancers (SCC) include basal cell carcinoma (BCC), melanoma,
intraepithelial carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Currently, the incidence of skin
cancer is higher than the incidence of other new types of lung and breast cancer. Many
skin conditions have symptoms that might be difficult to treat since they can develop for
months before being identified. As a result, computer-based disease diagnosis is used
since it may generate a result more quickly and accurately than human analysis using
laboratory techniques. The most popular technology for predicting skin diseases is deep
learning.


Skin disease detection and diagnosis in dermatology lack
accuracy and real-time capabilities. There is a need for an improved system that utilizes
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance the speed and accuracy of skin
disease detection. This research aims to develop a CNN-based skin disease detection
approach using the Gradient Descent Algorithm and large-scale datasets. The objective
is to improve the accuracy of skin disease detection and provide users with a user-
friendly interface to identify and understand different skin diseases.

The skin disease detection system analyses the submitted image once a user clicks the
Detect Skin Disease; button in order to locate and categorize the identified skin illness.

The system processes the image and extracts pertinent characteristics and patterns
using the trained model and its sophisticated algorithms.
